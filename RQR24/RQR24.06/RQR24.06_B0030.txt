Warning
 - A few of Logitech's devices (Wireless Mouse M335, Zone Touch Mouse T400,
   Wireless Mouse M545, Wireless Mouse M560, Touch Mouse M600, Touch Mouse
   T620, Wireless Rechargeable Touchpad T650) used to send select buttons in
   an unencrypted way, and in an effort to protect against this vulnerability,
   Logitech removed the feature.  Although Logitech does not recommend it,
   these features may be re-activated by keeping/downgrading the receiver to
   an older firmware.
